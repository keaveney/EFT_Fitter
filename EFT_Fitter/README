There are two methods to accommodat the systematic uncertainties of the data:

1) The data is varied within its systematic uncertainties by changing the error_mode flag in
the initalise routine from "nom" to "down" or "up".

2) The systematic uncertainties of the data are included in the chi^2 calculation. This
is done by setting the "schmitt_fit" flag in the calculate_test_statistic routine to
true.
